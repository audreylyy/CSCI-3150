            <h2>How Can we Apply This?</h2>
            <h3 id="semantic">Semantic Structure</h3>
            <p>
                Ensuring correct structure and semantic markups helps to ensure a web page is utilizing the benefits
                provided by Web Standards. Semantic structure helps with not only the presentation of the content but
                also structures it so the content can be efficiently used by Assistive Technology and systems that
                analyze web pages.
            </p>

            <p>
            Content hierarchy is extremely important for humans and machines to understand the information structure
            provided to them. Using headings was not necessarily created with visual design in mind, but provides that
            information needed to understand structure.
            </p>

            <p>
                Page regions like
                <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>
                    &lt;aside&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> help to define the semantic structure of a
                page. This assists
                screen readers to effectively navigate through these areas. These elements cannot be
                nested in each other, or else they are useless to a screen reader.
            </p>

            
            <h3 id="forms">Accessible Forms</h3>
            <p>
                When creating forms, we need to make sure they are accessible. If they are accessible it makes it easier
                for the user to understand and use. Putting specific instructions in form fields and fields should be
                showed to the users. If users do not complete it right, an error should be shown clearly. We also need
                to ensure that forms cannot just be solely used with a mouse for users who navigate pages with
                keyboards.
            </p>

            <p>
                Labels specifically show the function of what a field on a form is supposed to do. Using
                <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> makes it so a label is connected to that field.
            </p>

            <h3 id="gridlayout">CSS Grid Layout</h3>
            <p>
                Grid layouts changed the way web developers design interfaces. Using grid in CSS solves layout issues
                and makes them more aesthetically pleasing to the eye, while ensuring it doesn’t change the ordering of
                screen readers. CSS grid layout allows us to move items without having to make big changes to layouts.
            </p>

            <h3 id="flexboxlay">Flexbox Layout</h3>
            <p>
                Flexbox allows us as web developers to efficiently lay out, design, align, and distribute space in
                different items in a container dynamically. It gives the container the ability to change its item’s size
                (width/height) to best fill the space. This helps to accommodate all devices and screen sizes, which is
                especially important for mobile use.
            </p>

            <h3 id="tables">Accessible Tables</h3>
            <p>
                We can use tables to logically organize data in grids. To make them accessible we need to use markups to
                clearly indicate different cells and define relationships so assistive technologies can utilize it.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can use <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> to mark header cells, <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> for data cells.
            </p>

            <p>
                If our tables don’t use clear structures to link the whole thing together, it creates barriers for those
                using assistive technologies. People using screen readers are able to have row and columns read aloud as
                they navigate through the table, and hear what header the data is associated with.
            </p>

            <h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
            <p>
                There are many different tools that are free and easily accessible for us as web developers to check if
                our sites meet accessibility. Tools like WAVE Evaluation tool can check if color contrast is clear for
                users with visual impairments, and also checks it meets a number of universal design guidelines. The
                WebDev Toolbar is also a chrome extension that checks semantic structures, alt images, validate
                accessibility, CSS, and HTML, and more. We can go through the WCAG guidelines and check if our website
                meets them. We can also test screen reading on our devices to see if the information is being properly
                conveyed to users.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some specific things we can check ourselves is the page title (<code>&lt;title&gt;</code> in
                <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>). The title should convey where the user is as they move tabs. It should
                briefly describe the content of the page. We can also check alt text on images and make sure screen
                readers properly convey what it is showing. To use alt text in our code we can just do
                <code>&lt;img src = “pointer” alt = “description of image”&gt;</code>. Checking that all heading have
                meaningful hierarchy is also important, there should only be one heading level 1. Using tools like Adobe
                color to check color contrast and WAVE can check if there is clear contrast between the text and
                background. We can also check the website is navigable through keyboard by tabbing through the webpage.
