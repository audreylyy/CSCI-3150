            <h2>Importance</h2>
            <h3 id="diversity">Diversity of Web Users</h3>
            <p>
                Ensuring a web for everyone, means people with different abilities can use the web to the capability
                it's intended for. Every person is different and unique, we all have diverse abilities, preferences,
                skills, etc and this all affects the way we use technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because everyone has different abilities, we have to consider different things. One is age-related
                impairments, where older people struggle to use technology. We also consider individuals with multiple
                disabilities, which can affect how they interact with digital devices. Individuals with health
                conditions that can affect their concentration, stamina, etc also have to be considered because their
                symptoms can impact how they use technology and for how long. Others can experience recurring functional
                limitations that affect their use of technology. Some people are temporarily impaired and struggle to
                use technology. There also exists situational limitations where there are impairments in using
                technology in different situations, like not being able to hear audio, etc.
            </p>
            <h3 id="whyWeNeed">Why do we Need it?</h3>
            <p>
                The diversity of web users is greatly spread out and not just based on disabilities, so it is important
                to use universal design guidelines to build websites that everyone can use and enjoy despite their
                limitations.
            </p>

            <p>
                The World Health Organization estimates 16% of the world's population experience disabilities. This is
                about 1.3 billion people. The number only continues to rise with the growing population and with an 
                aging population. In the United States, 1 in 4 people have a disability. 
            </p>

            <p>
                It is increasingly important to make sure technology is accessible for everyone and it can be utilized
                by everyone. Much of the world is increasingly using technology, and leaving behind a population by not
                making the web accessible is leaving them at a disadvantage and is not equitable. By applying universal
                design on webpages, we can ensure that all users are able to fully maximize the capabilities of the Internet.
