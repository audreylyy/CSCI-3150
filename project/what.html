                <h2 id="whatIs">What is Universal Design?</h2>

                <p>
                    Universal Design is creating a product that can be accessed, utilized, and understood by any person,
                    regardless of their age, ability, or disability. It is created on the view that the spectrum of
                    people’s
                    abilities is wide and our abilities can change over time. We can use universal design to meet the
                    needs
                    of all users to the greatest extent without having to adapt or make designs for different
                    populations.
                    This not only makes it easier for the user themselves, but us as web developers and designers as it
                    sets
                    out guidelines for how to design a universally accessible website so different versions do not have
                    to
                    be adapted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In universal design, we consider the diverse needs and abilities of all users in creation to meet
                    all
                    users needs. If our products are universally designed, and are accessible, usable it is a good
                    design.

                <h2 id="7principles">7 Principles of Universal Design</h2>

                <p>
                    In 1997, Ronald Mace and his colleagues at North Carolina State University developed the 7
                    Principles of
                    Universal Design
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Equitable Use</h3>
                        <p>Design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide same means of use for all users, identical when possible, equivalent when not
                            </li>
                            <li>Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users</li>
                            <li>Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users
                            </li>
                            <li>Make the design appealing to all users.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Flexibility in Use</h3>
                        <p>The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide choice in methods of use</li>
                            <li>Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use</li>
                            <li>Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Simple and Intuitive Use</h3>
                        <p>Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge,
                            language
                            skills, or current concentration level</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eliminate unnecessary complexity</li>
                            <li>Be consistent with user expectations and intuition</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Perceptible Information</h3>
                        <p>The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient
                            conditions or the user's sensory abilities</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant presentation of essential
                                information</li>

                            <li>Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices used by people with
                                sensory
                                limitations</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Tolerance for Error</h3>
                        <p>The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors: most used elements, most accessible;
                                hazardous elements eliminated, isolated, or shielded</li>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Low Physical Effort</h3>
                        <p>The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Size and Space for Approach and Use</h3>
                        <p>Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless
                            of
                            user's body size, posture, or mobility</p>
                        <ul>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Visibility</h3>
                        <p>If functions are visible, users are more likely know what to do. If they are hidden, users
                            can
                            struggle to find them and use them</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Feedback</h3>
                        <p>When a user completes an action, feedback can send back information on what the user did, so
                            they
                            are aware if their action is successful or not</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Constraints</h3>
                        <p>A user is restricted from doing certain actions to prevent errors, misuse, or damage to the
                            device or user</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Mapping</h3>
                        <p>The presentation of controls that will mirror the operation that is going to be performed. It
                            can
                            also with position/proximity indicate the device/component associated with the control</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Consistency</h3>
                        <p>Design interfaces to have similar operations and similar elements to achieve similar tasks
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Affordance</h3>
                        <p>The link between how things look and how they’re used. A mouse has is an example of an item
                            having good affordance. The buttons on a mouse invite pushing</p>

                <h2 id="wcag">WCAG</h2>


                <p>
                    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are guidelines that define how to make web content
                    accessible to people with disabilities, other individuals with abilities that change due to aging,
                    and
                    can help improve usability for users in general. WCAG helps to develop web accessibility standards
                    for
                    web and software developers.
                </p>

                <h3>WCAG Principles</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Perceivable</h4>
                        <p>Information and user interface components are presented in a way users can see/hear</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Operable</h4>
                        <p>Designed so users can interact with them and support assistive technologies</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Understandable</h4>
                        <p>Information and operation of user interface clearly and consistently communicates content so
                            it is readable</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Robust</h4>
                        <p>Content must be written so it can be interpreted reliably by wide variety of user agents,
                            including assistive technologies</p>
                    </li>
