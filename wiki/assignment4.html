                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries
                    to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has been
                    a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was
                    introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of volleyball
                    at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.

                <p>

                    The complete set of rules is extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one
                    of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with
                    a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the
                    receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court.
                    The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court, but
                    individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the first two touches
                    are used to set up for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in
                    such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus,
                    losing the point. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the
                    next rally. A few of the most common faults include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents' court or without first
                        passing over the net;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        catching and throwing the ball;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        net foul: touching the net during play;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving or under the net when a front
                        row player is trying to keep the ball in play.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short
                contact) the ball with any part of the body.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking
                    (because those plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill
                    emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, and specialized player positions. Offensive
                    and defensive structures are also key plays.

                <h3>Origin</h3>

                    <figcaption>Photo of William G. Morgan in 1915.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    William G. Morgan invented the sport in 1895 while he was the YMCA physical education director in
                    Holyoke, Massachusetts. Because he originally derived the game from badminton, he initially named
                    the sport mintonette. He was a one-time student of basketball inventor James Naismith and
                    invented the game for his clients at the YMCA, most of whom were middle-aged businessmen for whom
                    the physical demands of basketball were too great.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first rules, written down by Morgan, called for a net 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) high, a 25 ft × 50 ft
                    (7.6 m × 15.2 m) court, and any number of players. A match was composed of nine innings with three
                    serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team
                    before sending the ball to the opponents' court. In case of a serving error, a second try was
                    allowed. Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul (with loss of the point or a
                    side-out)—except in the case of the first-try serve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition
                    match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College),
                    the game quickly became known as volleyball (it was originally spelled as two words: "volley ball").
                    Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game
                    spread around the country to various YMCAs.
                </p>
                <p>In the early 1900s Spalding, through its publishing company American Sports Publishing Company,
                    produced books with complete instruction and rules for the sport.

                </p>
                <h3>Refinements and later developments</h3>
                <p>
                    The first official ball used in volleyball is disputed; some sources say Spalding created the first
                    official ball in 1896, while others claim it was created in 1900. The rules evolved over
                    time: in 1916, in the Philippines, the skill and power of the set and spike had been introduced, and
                    four years later a "three hits" rule and a rule against hitting from the back row were established.
                    In 1917, the game was changed from requiring 21 points to win to a smaller 15 points to win. In
                    1919, about 16,000 volleyballs were distributed by the American Expeditionary Forces to their troops
                    and allies, which sparked the growth of volleyball in new countries.

                <p>
                    Like basketball, volleyball spread quickly due to its simplicity and promotion by the YMCA and
                    YWCA. The first country outside the United States to adopt volleyball was Canada in 1900.
                    During and after World War I, the presence of YMCA instructors in American forces led to the spread
                    of volleyball in Europe, where clubs were established in France as well as several Soviet
                    nations. An international federation, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), was
                    founded in 1947, and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952 for women.
                    The sport is now popular in Brazil, in Europe, where especially Italy, the Netherlands, and Eastern
                    Europe have been major forces since the late 1980s, in Russia, in other countries, including China
                    and the rest of Asia, and in the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beach volleyball, a variation of the game played on sand and with only two players per team, became
                    a FIVB-endorsed variation in 1987 and was added to the Olympic program at the 1996 Summer
                    Olympics. Volleyball is also a sport at the Paralympics managed by World ParaVolley.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nudists were early adopters of the game with regular organized play in clubs as early as the late
                    1920s. By the 1960s, a volleyball court had become standard in almost all nudist/naturist
                    clubs. Recently a debate has arisen within the sport regarding the inclusion of transgender
                    players. With transgender athletes including Tiffany Abreu joining professional volleyball teams
                    alongside other non-transgender teammates, many professionals, sports analysts, and fans of
                    volleyball either express concerns about the legitimacy and fairness of having transgender players
                    on a team or convey support for the transgender players.
                </p>
                <h3>Volleyball in the Olympics</h3>
                <p>
                    Volleyball has been part of the Summer Olympics program for both men and women consistently since
                    1964.

                <h2>Rules of the game</h2>

                <h3>Court dimensions</h3>

                <p>
                    A volleyball court is 9 m × 18 m (29.5 ft × 59.1 ft), divided into equal square halves by a net with
                    a width of one meter (39.4 in). The top of the net is 2.43 m (7 ft 11+11⁄16 in) above the center
                    of the court for men's competition, and 2.24 m (7 ft 4+3⁄16 in) for women's competition, varied for
                    veterans and junior competitions.
                </p>

                <figure id="volleyball-court-img">

                        alt="Volleyball court with different dimensions on the side. Depicts the court being 9 meters by 18 meters.">
                    <figcaption>Volleyball court dimensions.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The minimum height clearance for indoor volleyball courts is 7 m (23.0 ft), although a clearance of
                    8 m (26.2 ft) is recommended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A line 3 m (9.8 ft) from and parallel to the net is considered the "attack line". This "3 meter" (or
                    "10-foot") line divides the court into "back row" and "front row" areas and the back court and front
                    court. These are in turn divided into 3 areas each: these are numbered as follows, starting from
                    area "1", which is the position of the serving player:
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a team gains the serve (also known as siding out), its members must rotate in a clockwise
                    direction, with the player previously in area "2" moving to area "1" and so on, with the player from
                    area "1" moving to area "6". Each player rotates only one time after the team gains possession of
                    the service; the next time each player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the
                    ball and loses the point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team courts are surrounded by an area called the free zone which is a minimum of 3 meters wide
                    and which the players may enter and play within after the service of the ball. All lines
                    denoting the boundaries of the team court and the attack zone are drawn or painted within the
                    dimensions of the area and are therefore a part of the court or zone. If a ball comes in contact
                    with the line, the ball is considered to be "in". An antenna is placed on each side of the net
                    perpendicular to the sideline and is a vertical extension of the side boundary of the court. A ball
                    passing over the net must pass completely between the antennae (or their theoretical extensions to
                    the ceiling) without contacting them.
                </p>

                <h3>The ball</h3>

                <p>
                    FIVB regulations state that the ball must be spherical, made of leather or synthetic leather, have a
                    circumference of 65–67 cm (26–26 in), a weight of 260–280 g (9.2–9.9 oz) and an interior air
                    pressure of 0.30–0.325 kg/cm2 (4.26 to 4.61 psi; 294.3 to 318.82 mbar or hPa).[23] Other governing
                    bodies have similar regulations.
                </p>

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>

                <p>
                    Each team consists of six players. To get play started, a team is chosen to serve by coin toss.
                    A player from the serving team throws the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it
                    passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court (the serve).
                    The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to
                    return the ball to the opponent's side of the net. These contacts usually consist first of the
                    bump or pass so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the setter;
                    second of the set (usually an over-hand pass using wrists to push finger-tips at the ball) by the
                    setter so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one of the players designated as
                    an attacker can hit it, and third by the attacker who spikes (jumping, raising one arm above the
                    head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent's court) to
                    return the ball over the net. The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the
                    ball as described is said to be on offence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team on defence attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court:
                    players at the net jump and reach above the top (and if possible, across the plane) of the net to
                    block the attacked ball. If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive
                    players arranged in the rest of the court attempt to control the ball with a dig (usually a fore-arm
                    pass of a hard-driven ball). After a successful dig, the team transitions to offence.

                </figure>

                <p>
                    The game continues in this manner, rallying back and forth until the ball touches the court within
                    the boundaries or until an error is made. The most frequent errors that are made are either to
                    fail to return the ball over the net within the allowed three touches, or to cause the ball to land
                    outside the court. A ball is "in" if any part of it touches the inside of a team's court or a
                    sideline or end-line, and a strong spike may compress the ball enough when it lands that a ball
                    which at first appears to be going out may actually be in. Players may travel well outside the court
                    to play a ball that has gone over a sideline or end-line in the air. A standard competitive
                    volleyball match is played in a best-of-five sets format and typically goes on for about 90
                    minutes.

                <p>
                    Other common errors include a player touching the ball twice in succession, a player catching the
                    ball, a player touching the net while attempting to play the ball, or a player penetrating under the
                    net into the opponent's court. There are a large number of other errors specified in the rules,
                    although most of them are infrequent occurrences. These errors include back-row or libero players
                    spiking the ball or blocking (back-row players may spike the ball if they jump from behind the
                    attack line), players not being in the correct position when the ball is served, attacking the serve
                    in the front court and above the height of the net, using another player as a source of support to
                    reach the ball, stepping over the back boundary line when serving, taking more than 8 seconds to
                    serve, or playing the ball when it is above the opponent's court.

                    <figcaption>A scorer's table shown just before a volleyball game.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    A point is scored when the ball contacts the floor within the court boundaries or when an error is
                    made: when the ball strikes one team's side of the court, the other team gains a point; and when an
                    error is made, the team that did not make the error is awarded a point, in either case paying no
                    regard to whether they served the ball or not. If any part of the ball hits the line, the ball is
                    counted as in the court. The team that won the point serves for the next point. If the team which
                    won the point served in the previous point, the same player serves again. If the team that won the
                    point did not serve the previous point, the players of the team acquiring the serve rotate their
                    position on the court in a clockwise manner. The game continues, with the first team to score 25
                    points by a two-point margin awarded the set. Matches are best-of-five sets and the fifth set, if
                    necessary, is usually played to 15 points. (Scoring differs between leagues, tournaments, and
                    levels; high schools sometimes play best-of-three to 25; in the NCAA matches are played best-of-five
                    to 25 as of the 2008 season.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before 1999, points could be scored only when a team had the serve (side-out scoring) and all sets
                    went up to only 15 points. The FIVB changed the rules in 1999 (with the changes being compulsory in
                    2000) to use the current scoring system (formerly known as rally point system), primarily to make
                    the length of the match more predictable and to make the game more spectator- and
                    television-friendly. The final year of side-out scoring at the NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball
                    Championship was 2000. Rally point scoring debuted in 2001, and games were played to 30 points
                    through 2007. For the 2008 season, games were renamed "sets" and reduced to 25 points to win. Most
                    high schools in the U.S. changed to rally scoring in 2003, and several states
                    implemented it the previous year on an experimental basis.
                </p>

                <h3>Libero</h3>

                <p>
                    The libero player was introduced internationally in 1998, and made its debut for NCAA
                    competition in 2002. The libero is a player specialized in defensive skills: the libero must
                    wear a contrasting jersey color from their teammates and cannot block or attack the ball when it is
                    entirely above net height. When the ball is not in play, the libero can replace any back-row player,
                    without prior notice to the officials. This replacement does not count against the substitution
                    limit each team is allowed per set, although the libero may be replaced only by the player whom he
                    or she replaced. Most U.S. high schools added the libero position from 2003 to 2005.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The modern-day libero often takes on the role of a second setter. When the setter digs the ball, the
                    libero is typically responsible for the second ball and sets to the front row attacker. The libero
                    may function as a setter only under certain restrictions. To make an overhand set, the libero must
                    be standing behind (and not stepping on) the 3-meter line; otherwise, the ball cannot be attacked
                    above the net in front of the 3-meter line. An underhand pass is allowed from any part of the court.
                    The libero is, generally, the most skilled defensive player on the team. There is also a libero
                    tracking sheet, where the referees or officiating team must keep track of whom the libero subs in
                    and out for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under FIVB rules, a libero is not allowed to serve. By contrast, a libero can serve in NCAA
                    volleyball, but only in a specific rotation. That is, the libero can only serve for one person, not
                    for all of the people for whom he or she goes in. That rule change was implemented in 2004 and
                    applied to high school and junior high play soon after.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under FIVB rules, each team can designate two liberos at the beginning of play, only one of whom can
                    be on the court at any time, and each libero can serve in one specific rotation. This rule was
                    implemented in NCAA women's volleyball, effective with the fall 2024 season.
                </p>

                <h3>Recent rule changes</h3>

                <p>
                    Other rule changes enacted in 2000 include allowing serves in which the ball touches the net, as
                    long as it goes over the net into the opponents' court. Also, the service area was expanded to allow
                    players to serve from anywhere behind the end line but still within the theoretical extension of the
                    sidelines. Other changes were made to lighten up calls on faults for carries and double-touches,
                    such as allowing multiple contacts by a single player ("double-hits") on a team's first contact
                    provided that they are a part of a single play on the ball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2008, the NCAA changed the minimum number of points needed to win any of the first four sets from
                    30 to 25 for women's volleyball (men's volleyball remained at 30 for another three years, switching
                    to 25 in 2011). If a fifth (deciding) set is reached, the minimum required score remains at 15. In
                    addition, the word "game" is now referred to as "set".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Official Volleyball Rules are prepared and updated every few years by the FIVB's Rules of the
                    Game and Refereeing Commission. The latest edition is usually available on the FIVB's website.

                <h2>Skills</h2>

                <p>
                    Competitive teams master six basic skills: serve, pass, set, attack, block and dig. Each of the
                    skills consitsts of a number of specific techniques which have been introduced over the years
                    and are now considered standard practice in high-level volleyball.

                <h3>Serve</h3>

                <figure id="serve">

                        alt="Man jumping in the air with his right arm up about to hit the volleyball. Preforming jumpserve to begin the game">
                    <figcaption>A player making a jump serve.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    A player stands behind the inline and serves the ball in an attempt to drive it into the
                    opponent's court. The main objective is to make it land inside the court; it is also desirable
                    to set the ball's direction, speed and acceleration so that it becomes difficult for the
                    receiver to handle it properly. A serve is called an "ace" when the ball either lands
                    directly onto the opponent's court or the first opponent to touch the ball is unable to volley
                    it (hit it upwards enough for a teammate to continue).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contemporary volleyball, many types of serves are employed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Underhand: a serve in which the player strikes the ball below the waist instead of tossing
                        it up and striking it with an overhand throwing motion. Underhand serves are considered very
                        easy to receive and are rarely employed in high-level competitions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sky ball serve: a specific type of underhand serve occasionally used in beach volleyball,
                        where the ball is hit so high it comes down almost in a straight line. This serve was
                        invented and employed almost exclusively by the Brazilian team in the early 1980s and is now
                        considered outdated. During the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, however, the sky ball
                        serve was extensively played by Italian beach volleyball player Adrian Carambula. In Brazil,
                        this serve is called Jornada nas Estrelas (Star Trek).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Topspin: an overhand serve where the player tosses the ball high and hits it with a wrist
                        snap, giving it topspin which causes it to drop faster than it would otherwise and helps
                        maintain a straight flight path. Topspin serves are generally hit hard and aimed at a
                        specific returner or part of the court. Standing topspin serves are rarely used above the
                        high school level of play.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Float: an overhand serve where the ball is hit with no spin so that its path becomes
                        unpredictable, akin to a knuckleball in baseball.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jump serve: an overhand serve where the ball is first tossed high in the air, then the
                        player makes a timed approach and jumps to make contact with the ball, hitting it with much
                        pace and topspin. This is the most popular serve among college and professional teams.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jump float: an overhand serve where the ball is tossed high enough that the player may jump
                        before hitting it similarly to a standing float serve. The ball is tossed lower than a
                        topspin jump serve, but contact is still made while in the air. This serve is becoming more
                        popular among college and professional players because it has a certain unpredictability in
                        its flight pattern.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Pass</h3>

                <figure id="pass">
                    <img id="pass-volleybal" src="img/pass.jpg"
                        alt="Woman with both her arms out, holding her hands together, about to pass the volleyball">
                    <figcaption>A player making a forearm pass or bump</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Also called reception, the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent's serve
                    or any form of attack. Proper handling includes not only preventing the ball from touching the
                    court but also making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely.
                </p>
                

                <p>
                    The skill of passing involves fundamentally two specific techniques: underarm pass, or bump,
                    where the ball touches the inside part of the joined forearms or platform, at waistline; and
                    overhand pass, where it is handled with the fingertips, like a set, above the head.[3] Either
                    are acceptable in professional and beach volleyball; however, there are much tighter regulations
                    on the overhand pass in beach volleyball. When a player passes a ball to their setter, it is
                    ideal that the ball does not have a lot of spin to make it easier for the setter.
                </p>
                <h3>Set</h3>
                <p>
                    The set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball. The main goal of setting
                    is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the
                    opponent's court. The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team, and is the player
                    who ultimately decides which player will actually attack the ball.
                </p>

                <figure id="jumpset">
                    <img id="jump-set" src="img/jumpset.jpg"
                        alt="Two woman on a volleyball court, one woman in jumping up with her hands in the air about to set the ball. The other is on the ground watching the ball, getting ready to attack">
                    <figcaption>Jump set</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    As with passing, one may distinguish between an overhand and a bump set. Since the former allows
                    for more control over the speed and direction of the ball, the bump is used only when the ball
                    is so low it cannot be properly handled with fingertips, or in beach volleyball where rules
                    regulating overhand setting are more stringent. In the case of a set, one also speaks of a front
                    or back set, meaning whether the ball is passed in the direction the setter is facing or behind
                    the setter. There is also a jump set that is used when the ball is too close to the net. In this
                    case, the setter usually jumps off their right foot straight up to avoid going into the net. The
                    setter usually stands about ⅔ of the way from the left to the right of the net and faces the
                    left (the larger portion of net that the setter can see).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sometimes a setter refrains from raising the ball for a teammate to perform an attack and tries
                    to play it directly onto the opponent's court. This movement is called a "dump". This can only
                    be performed when the setter is in the front row, otherwise it constitutes an illegal back court
                    attack. The most common dumps are to 'throw' the ball behind the setter or in front of the
                    setter to zones 2 and 4. More experienced setters toss the ball into the deep corners or spike
                    the ball on the second hit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with a set or an overhand pass, the setter/passer must be careful to touch the ball with both
                    hands at the same time. If one hand is noticeably late to touch the ball this could result in
                    a less effective set, as well as the referee calling a 'double hit' and giving the point to the
                    opposing team.
                </p>
                <h3>Attack</h3>
                <p>
                    The attack, also known as the spike, is usually the third contact a team makes with the ball.
                    The object of attacking is to handle the ball so that it lands on the opponent's court and
                    cannot be defended. A player makes a series of steps (the "approach"), jumps, and swings at the
                    ball.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ideally, the contact with the ball is made at the apex of the hitter's jump. At the moment of
                    contact, the hitter's arm is fully extended above their head and slightly forward, making the
                    highest possible contact while maintaining the ability to deliver a powerful hit. The hitter
                    uses arm swing, wrist snap, and a rapid forward contraction of the entire body to drive the
                    ball. A 'bounce' is a slang term for a very hard/loud spike that follows an almost straight
                    trajectory steeply downward into the opponent's court and bounces very high into the air. A
                    "kill" is the slang term for an attack that is not returned by the other team thus resulting in
                    a point.

                    Contemporary volleyball comprises a number of attacking techniques:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Backcourt (or back row): an attack performed by a back-row player. The player must jump from
                        behind the 3-meter line before making contact with the ball, but may land in front of the
                        3-meter line. A Pipe Attack is when the center player in the back row attacks the ball.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Line and Cross-court Shot: refers to whether the ball flies in a straight trajectory
                        parallel to the sidelines, or crosses through the court in an angle. A cross-court shot with
                        a very pronounced angle, resulting in the ball landing near the 3-meter line, is called a
                        cut shot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dip/Dink/Tip/Cheat/Dump: the player does not try to make a hit, but touches the ball
                        lightly, so that it lands on an area of the opponent's court that is not being covered by
                        the defence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tool/Wipe/Block-abuse: the player does not try to make a hard spike, but hits the ball so
                        that it touches the opponent's block and then bounces off-court.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Off-speed hit: the player does not hit the ball hard, reducing its speed and thus confusing
                        the opponent's defence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Quick hit/"One": an attack (usually by the middle blocker) where the approach and jump begin
                        before the setter contacts the ball. The set (called a "quick set") is placed only slightly
                        above the net and the ball is struck by the hitter almost immediately after leaving the
                        setter's hands. Quick attacks are often effective because they isolate the middle blocker to
                        be the only blocker on the hit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slide: a variation of the quick hit that uses a low backset. The middle hitter steps around
                        the setter and hits from behind him or her.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Double quick hit/"Stack"/"Tandem": a variation of quick hit where two hitters, one in front
                        and one behind the setter or both in front of the setter, jump to perform a quick hit at the
                        same time. It can be used to deceive opposite blockers and free a fourth hitter attacking
                        from back-court, maybe without block at all.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Block</h3>
                <p>
                    Blocking refers to the actions taken by players standing at the net to stop or alter an opponent's
                    attack. A block which is aimed at completely stopping an attack, thus making the ball remain in the
                    opponent's court, is called an offensive block. A well-executed offensive block is performed by
                    jumping and reaching to penetrate with one's arms and hands over the net and into the opponent's
                    area. It requires anticipating the direction the ball will go once the attack takes place. It may
                    also require calculating the best footwork to executing the "perfect" block.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The jump should be timed so as to intercept the ball's trajectory prior to it crossing over the
                    plane of the net. Palms are held deflected downward roughly 45–60 degrees toward the interior of the
                    opponents' court. A "roof" is a spectacular offensive block that redirects the power and speed of
                    the attack straight down to the attacker's floor as if the attacker hit the ball into the underside
                    of a peaked house roof. By contrast, it is called a defensive, or "soft" block if the goal is to
                    control and deflect the hard-driven ball up so that it slows down and becomes easier to defend. A
                    well-executed soft-block is performed by jumping and placing one's hands above the net with no
                    penetration into the opponent's court and with the palms up and fingers pointing backwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blocking is also classified according to the number of players involved. Thus, there are single (or
                    solo), double, and triple blocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Successful blocking does not always result in a "roof" and many times does not even touch the ball.
                    While it is obvious that a block was a success when the attacker is roofed, a block that
                    consistently forces the attacker away from their 'power' or preferred attack into a more easily
                    controlled shot by the defence is also a highly successful block. At the same time, the block
                    position influences the positions where other defenders place themselves while opponent hitters are
                    spiking.
                </p>
                <h3>Dig</h3>
                <p>
                    Digging is the ability to prevent the ball from touching one's court after a spike or attack,
                    particularly a ball that is nearly touching the ground. In many aspects, this skill is similar to
                    passing, or bumping: overhand dig and bump are also used to distinguish between defensive actions
                    taken with fingertips or with joined arms. It varies from passing, however, in that it is a much
                    more reflex-based skill, especially at the higher levels. It is especially important while digging
                    for players to stay on their toes; several players choose to employ a split step to make sure they
                    are ready to move in any direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some specific techniques are more common in digging than in passing. A player may sometimes perform
                    a "dive", i.e., throw their body in the air with a forward movement in an attempt to save the ball,
                    and land on their chest. When the player also slides their hand under a ball which is almost
                    touching the court it is called a "pancake". The pancake is frequently used in indoor volleyball,
                    but rarely if ever in beach volleyball because the uneven and yielding nature of the sand court
                    limits the chances that the ball will make good, clean contact with the hand. When used correctly,
                    it is one of the more spectacular defensive volleyball plays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes a player may also be forced to drop their body quickly to the floor to save the ball. In
                    this situation, the player makes use of a specific rolling technique to minimize the chances of
                    injuries.

                <h2>Team play</h2>
                <p>
                    Volleyball is essentially a game of transition from one of the above skills to the next, with
                    choreographed team movement between plays on the ball. The team's movements are determined by the
                    teams chosen serve receive system, offensive system, coverage system, and defensive system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The serve-receive system is the formation used by the receiving team to attempt to pass the ball to
                    the designated setter. Systems can consist of 5 receivers, 4 receivers, 3 receivers, and in some
                    cases 2 receivers. The most popular formation at higher levels is a 3 receiver formation consisting
                    of two left sides and a libero receiving every rotation. This allows middles and right sides to
                    become more specialized at hitting and blocking. Offensive systems are the formations used by the
                    offence to attempt to ground the ball into the opposing court (or otherwise score points).
                    Formations often include designated player positions with skill specialization. Popular formations
                    include the 4–2, 6–2, and 5-1 systems. There are also several different attacking schemes teams can
                    use to keep the opposing defence off balance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Coverage systems are the formations used by the offence to protect their court in the case of a
                    blocked attack. Executed by the 5 offensive players not directly attacking the ball, players move to
                    assigned positions around the attacker to dig up any ball that deflects off the block back into
                    their own court. Popular formations include the 2-3 system and the 1-2-2 system. In lieu of a
                    system, some teams just use a random coverage with the players nearest the hitter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Defensive systems are the formations used by the defence to protect against the ball being grounded
                    into their court by the opposing team. The system will outline which players are responsible for
                    which areas of the court depending on where the opposing team is attacking from. Popular systems
                    include the 6-Up, 6-Back-Deep, and 6-Back-Slide defence. There are also several different blocking
                    schemes teams can employ to disrupt the opposing teams' offence. When one player is ready to serve,
                    some teams will line up their other five players in a screen to obscure the view of the receiving
                    team. This action is only illegal if the server makes use of the screen, so the call is made at the
                    referee's discretion as to the impact the screen made on the receiving team's ability to pass the
                    ball. The most common style of screening involves a W formation designed to take up as much
                    horizontal space as possible.

                <h3>Player specialization</h3>
                <p>
                    There are five positions filled on every volleyball team at the elite level: setter, outside hitter
                    (left-side hitter), middle hitter (middle blocker), opposite hitter (right-side hitter) and libero /
                    defensive specialist. Each of the positions plays a specific, key role in winning a volleyball
                    match.
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Setters have the task for orchestrating the offence of the team. They aim for the second touch
                        and their main responsibility is to place the ball in the air where the attackers can place the
                        ball into the opponents' court for a point. They have to be able to operate with the hitters,
                        manage the tempo of their side of the court and choose the right attackers to set. Setters need
                        to have a swift and skillful appraisal and tactical accuracy and must be quick at moving around
                        the court. At elite level, setters used to usually be the shortest players of a team (before
                        liberos were introduced), not being typically required to perform jump hits, but that would
                        imply need for short-term replacement by taller bench players when critical points required more
                        effective blocks; in the 1990s taller setters (e.g. Fabio Vullo, Peter Blangé) began being
                        deployed, in order to improve blocks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Liberos are defensive players who are responsible for receiving the attack or serve. They are
                        usually the players on the court with the quickest reaction time and best passing skills. Libero
                        means 'free' in Italian—they receive this name as they have the ability to substitute for any
                        other player on the court during each play (usually the middle blocker). Liberos are not
                        permitted to block or perform attacks, meaning they never play at the net, which allows shorter
                        players with strong passing and defensive skills to excel in the position and play an important
                        role in the team's success. A player designated as a libero for a match may not play other roles
                        during that match. Liberos wear a different colour jersey than their teammates
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Middle hitters, or middle blockers, are players that can perform very fast attacks that usually
                        take place near the setter. They are specialized in blocking since they must attempt to stop
                        equally fast plays from their opponents and then quickly set up a double block at the sides of
                        the court. In non-beginners play, every team will have two middle hitters. At elite levels,
                        middle hitters are usually the tallest players, whose limited agility is countered by their
                        height enabling more effective blocks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Outside hitters, or left-side hitters, attack from near the left antenna. The outside hitter is
                        usually the most consistent hitter on the team and gets the most sets. Inaccurate first passes
                        usually result in a set to the outside hitter rather than middle or opposite. Since most sets to
                        the outside are high, the outside hitter may take a longer approach, always starting from
                        outside the court sideline. In non-beginners play, there are again two outside hitters on every
                        team in every match. At elite level, outside hitters are slightly shorter than middle hitters
                        and opposite hitters, but have the best defensive skills, therefore always re-placing to the
                        middle while in the back row.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Opposite hitters, or right-side hitters, carry the defensive workload for a volleyball team in
                        the front row. Their primary responsibilities are to put up a well-formed block against the
                        opponents' Outside hitters and serve as a backup setter. Sets to the opposite usually go to the
                        right side of the antennae. Therefore, they are usually the most technical hitters since balls
                        lifted to the right side are quicker and more difficult to handle (the setters having to place
                        the ball while slightly off-set to the right, and with their back to the attacker), and also
                        having to jump from the back row when the setter is on the front row. At elite level, until the
                        1990s several opposite hitters used to be able to also play as middle hitters (e.g. Andrea
                        Zorzi, Andrea Giani), before high specialization curtailed this flexibility in the role.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    At some levels where substitutions are unlimited, teams will make use of a defensive specialist in
                    place of or in addition to a libero. This position does not have unique rules like the libero
                    position, instead, these players are used to substitute out a poor back row defender using regular
                    substitution rules. A defensive specialist is often used if you have a particularly poor back court
                    defender in right side or left side, but your team is already using a libero to take out your
                    middles. Most often, the situation involves a team using a right-side player with a big block who
                    must be subbed out in the back row because they are not able to effectively play backcourt defence.
                    Similarly, teams might use a serving specialist to sub out a poor server.
                </p>
                <h3>Formations</h3>
                <p>
                    The three standard volleyball formations are known as "4–2", "6–2" and "5–1", which refers to the
                    number of hitters and setters respectively. 4–2 is a basic formation used only in beginners' play,
                    while 5–1 is by far the most common formation in high-level play.
                </p>
                <h4>4-2</h4>
                <p>
                    The 4–2 formation has four hitters and two setters. The setters usually set from the middle front or
                    right front position. The team will, therefore, have two front-row attackers at all times. In the
                    international 4–2, the setters set from the right front position. The international 4–2 translates
                    more easily into other forms of offence. The setters line up opposite each other in the rotation.
                    The typical lineup has two outside hitters. By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the
                    rotation, there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows. After service, the
                    players in the front row move into their assigned positions, so that the setter is always in the
                    middle front. Alternatively, the setter moves into the right front and has both a middle and an
                    outside attacker; the disadvantage here lies in the lack of an offside hitter, allowing one of the
                    other team's blockers to "cheat in" on a middle block.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The clear disadvantage with this offensive formation is that there are only two attackers, leaving a
                    team with fewer offensive weapons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another aspect is to see the setter as an attacking force, albeit a weakened force, because when the
                    setter is in the frontcourt they are able to 'tip' or 'dump', so when the ball is close to the net
                    on the second touch, the setter may opt to hit the ball over with one hand. This means that the
                    blocker who would otherwise not have to block the setter is engaged and may allow one of the hitters
                    to have an easier attack.
                </p>
                <h4>6-2</h4>
                <p>
                    In the 6–2 formation, a player always comes forward from the back row to set. The three front row
                    players are all in attacking positions. As a result all six players act as hitters at one time or
                    another, while two can act as setters. So the 6–2 formation is actually a 4–2 system, but the
                    back-row setter penetrates to set. The 6–2 lineup thus requires two setters, who line up opposite to
                    each other in the rotation. In addition to the setters, a typical lineup will have two middle
                    hitters and two outside hitters. By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the rotation,
                    there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows. After service, the players in
                    the front row move into their assigned positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The advantage of the 6–2 is that there are always three front-row hitters available, maximizing the
                    offensive possibilities. However, not only does the 6–2 require a team to possess two people capable
                    of performing the highly specialized role of setter, it also requires both of those players to be
                    effective offensive hitters when not in the setter position. At the international level, only the
                    Cuban National Women's Team employs this kind of formation. It is also used by NCAA teams in
                    Division III men's play and women's play in all divisions, partially due to the variant rules used
                    which allow more substitutions per set than the 6 allowed in the standard rules—12 in matches
                    involving two Division III men's teams and 15 for all women's play.
                </p>
                <h4>5-1</h4>
                <p>
                    The 5–1 formation has only one player who assumes setting responsibilities regardless of their
                    position in the rotation. The team will, therefore, have three front-row attackers when the setter
                    is in the back row and only two when the setter is in the front row, for a total of five possible
                    attackers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this formation - The libero will replace a middle blocker in the back row.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player opposite the setter in a 5–1 rotation is called the opposite hitter. In general, opposite
                    hitters do not pass; they stand behind their teammates when the opponent is serving. The opposite
                    hitter may be used as a third attack option (back-row attack) when the setter is in the front row:
                    this is the normal option used to increase the attack capabilities of modern volleyball teams.
                    Normally the opposite hitter is the most technically skilled hitter of the team. Back-row attacks
                    generally come from the back-right position, known as zone 1, but are increasingly performed from
                    back-centre in high-level play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The big advantage of the system is that the setter always has 3 hitters with which to vary sets. If
                    the setter performs well, the opponent's middle blocker may not have enough time to block with the
                    outside blocker, increasing the chance for the attacking team to make a point.The big advantage of
                    the system is that the setter always has 3 hitters with which to vary sets. If the setter performs
                    well, the opponent's middle blocker may not have enough time to block with the outside blocker,
                    increasing the chance for the attacking team to make a point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is another advantage, the same as that of a 4–2 formation: as a front-row player the setter is
                    allowed to jump and "dump" the ball onto the opponent's side. Thus the setter can confuse the
                    opponent's blocking players; they have the option to jump and dump or set to one of the hitters. A
                    good setter knows and they are able to jump to dump or to set for a quick hit as well as when
                    setting outside, thus they are able to confuse the opponent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 5–1 offence is actually a mix of 6–2 and 4–2: when the setter is in the front row, the offense
                    looks like a 4–2; when the setter is in the back row, the offense looks like a 6–2.

                    There are many variations on the basic rules of volleyball. By far the most popular of these is
                    beach volleyball, which is played on sand with two people per team and rivals the main sport in
                    popularity.
