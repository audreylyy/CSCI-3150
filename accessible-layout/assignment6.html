            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated
                carnivorous
                mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and
                genetics
                have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is
                commonly
                kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by
                humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to
                killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp
                teeth,
                and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary
                hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations—including meowing,
                purring,
                trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting–as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or
                too
                high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives
                pheromones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout
                the
                year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats
                are
                bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population
                control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the
                abandonment of
                pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird,
                mammal, and reptile species.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million
                cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of
                adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021,
                there
                were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.

            <h2 class="sr-only" Cat Behavior></h2>
            <h2>Cat Behavior</h2>
            <p>
                Cat behavior generally refers to the behaviors and habits of domestic cats, including body language
                and communication. Cat behavior may vary among breeds and individual cats. Many common behaviors
                include hunting techniques and reactions to certain events as well as interactions with humans and
                other animals, such as dogs. Communication can vary greatly depending on a cat's temperament. In a
                family with multiple cats, social position can also affect behavior patterns with others. A cat's
                eating patterns can also vary depending on the owner's choice of food or eating times/quantities. In
                the case of a family having two or more cats, one cat may become dominant over the other cats.

            <h3 class="sr-only" Cat Behavior></h3>
            <h3>Body Language</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Disgust — The lifting or constant shaking of a paw or paws. The more times the paw is shaken,
                    the stronger the cat's feeling; this can sometimes be a four paw affair with each paw being
                    lifted and shaken in turn. This behavior is possibly related to the identical action displayed
                    after stepping into water. Displeasure at a situation can be shown by moving the ears back and
                    rapidly swishing the tail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Agitation or Aggression — the swishing or sweeping of the tail in a wide swath, in mid-air or
                    against a person. Tail flicking indicates inner conflict, while wide tail swishing shows
                    external conflict. Further irritation may result in the cat moving or leaving the room and even
                    physical aggression.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Contentedness — Kneading with the paws on a person or, for example, a favorite blanket or
                    sleeping spot. Young kittens knead their mother's nipples to stimulate the feeding reflex so
                    that her milk flows. Cats may knead for a short or extended period of time; the extended period
                    is sometimes interpreted by people as a sign of discomfort or restlessness, but it is more
                    likely that the cat is happy. Most cats will demonstrate this for about ten minutes at the
                    longest, although some have been known to knead and suckle on their favorite human's shirt or
                    ear lobe over the course of an entire night. Researchers at Oxford University have demonstrated
                    that cats derive immense pleasure from kneading, similar to the relaxing sensation for humans
                    from snacking on favorite foods or being massaged.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Relaxation — sprawling on the side or back and, possibly, rolling about; this may be seen, for
                    example, when a person enters the room or stirs from their seat. Sometimes they roll over onto
                    their back and shake their paws in the air. This behavior shows complete relaxation. The cat may
                    display this at the same time as the person's movement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Affection — a pressing of the face or top of the head against a person's body (head rubbing,
                    nuzzling), leaving a scent to mark the cat's territory; or rubbing in quick succession. Cats may
                    also blink slowly as an expression of affection or security. Many cats also use a question
                    mark-shaped tail to show desire to greet someone they are fond of. They will also stretch to
                    show they are content with their surroundings. Cats may also lick their owner or another person
                    to show affection.
                    Submission — Upon being approached, it will fall down on its side, indicating it is not seeking
                    attention and is unwilling to put up a fight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interest and Rejection — The position of the ears communicates the degree of desire to engage
                    with the situation around them. Ears up and moved slightly forward shows real interest in what
                    is going on, while ears moved backward shows distaste and desire to not engage with the
                    situation. Cats show disapproval by moving their ears back, an equivalent of a human frown. They
                    also crouch and turn their back to the situation to indicate disinterest or unhappiness. A cat
                    will either move a little or give a faint "meow" if it does not want to be picked up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Desire for Attention — To solicit attention (for food or affection) from humans, cats will rub
                    their bodies against the human's legs with back arched and tail raised. Less often, a cat may
                    reach out and touch a human with its forepaw to get attention.
